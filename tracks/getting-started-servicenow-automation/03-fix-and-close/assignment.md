üëã Introduction
====
A ServiceNow change is anything added, removed, or modified to address a problem that may be related to a past or ongoing incident.

A new playbook has been created in your `VS Code` tab.
- Review the new playbook called `change-attach.yml` as before

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Create a change request
====
- Navigate to `Resources > Job Templates` in automation controller and launch the job template `3 - Attach change request (change-attach.yml)`
- Watch for job completion in automation controller

üîç Inspect results
====
Go back to ServiceNow, select `Change - Open` under your favorites. This should list out all open change requests. You should see a new change request has been created with the title `"Reboot the webserver"`. Notice how other relevant fields (such as 'Description' and 'On hold reason') have been updated as well.

Move onto the next section by selecting the green "Next" button below.
