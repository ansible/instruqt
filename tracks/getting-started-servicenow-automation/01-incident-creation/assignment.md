    The ServiceNow integration for Ansible Automation Platform is made possible
    through a certified content collection called `servicenow.itsm`.  This collection
    is made available on Automation Hub on [console.redhat.com](https://console.redhat.com). The environment that
    is being created for you includes this collection in an execution environment
    that allows Ansible Automation Platform to execute tasks against a ServiceNow
    instance.

üëã Introduction
====
In ITIL, an incident refers to an unplanned outage or reduction in quality of an IT service or application. ServiceNow implements technology mapped to ITIL terminology and is accepted as an industry standard for incident management.

The servicenow.itsm certified collection allows organizations to leverage incident management within Ansible Automation Platform workflows.

A playbook has been created in the `VS Code` tab called `incident-create.yml`.
- Inspect this playbook and review the in-line comments to understand how the collection is being leveraged.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Create incident
====
- Next, use the login credentials supplied in `readme.md` to access the Automation Controller tab.

- Navigate to `Resources > Templates` and press the rocket icon to launch the `1 - Create incident (incident-create.yml)` job.

üîç Inspect results
====

If the previous step completed successfully, you should see a new incident has been created. To verify that this is the case:
- Use the ServiceNow credentials listed below or from `readme.md` to access ServiceNow from the `ServiceNow` tab.


| key | value |
| -------- | -------- |
| username     | [[ Instruqt-Var key="SANDBOX" hostname="controller" ]]     |
| password  | [[ Instruqt-Var key="SANDBOX" hostname="controller" ]]


- In ServiceNow, click the star icon to access pre-configured favorites and select `Self-service - Incidents`:

You should see a new Incident has been created! To verify this was done by you, access your newly created incident using the bullet and screenshot above. Your unique username for this environment should be shown in the Incident description. The incident number should also match the incident number displayed in the job execution output within Automation Controller.

Move onto the next section by selecting the green "Next" button below.
