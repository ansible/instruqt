üìë 1.4 - Job Templates
===

In automation controller a [job template](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html) is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible job,  which is usually known as a playbook. **Job Templates** are useful to execute the same job many times. Job templates also encourage the reuse of Ansible content and collaboration between teams.

To create a **Job Template** you need to have a **Project** from which to source our **Playbooks**. We created our project in the previous challenge. Also note that although a **Project** might contain multiple **Playbooks**, a **Job Template** can only run one of those playbooks.

In automation controller when we want to run multiple playbooks we need to use a **Job Template Workflow**, which we will review in another challenge ahead.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not confuse a Job Template with a Jinja template. Jinja templates are used to create dynamic files, with variables and facts usually for configuration files. If you don't know Jinja, don't worry about it right now, just know that they are different things.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Creation of the Job Template
===

1. Click the **Templates** link in the **Resources** section of the sidebar
2. Click the **Add** dropdown button and select **Add job template**

5. For the **Inventory** field, touch the magnifying glass and select `Lab-Inventory`
6. For the **Project** field, touch the magnifying glass and select `Apache playbooks`
7. For the **Playbook** dropdown field, you will notice that it's auto populated with all the playbooks available in the **Project** repository we selected. Choose the `apache.yml`.
8. For the **Credentials** field,  touch the magnifying glass and select `lab-credentials`
9. Leave all the other fields the same and click **Save**

‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Launch the new Template
===

1. Click the **Templates** link in the **Resources** section of the sidebar
2. You can launch it from this list, by clicking the **Rocket** icon, or
3. You can click on the `Install Apache` template and then click the **Launch** button at the bottom.
4. Verify the execution was successful

‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Verify Apache is working in node1 and node2
===

1. In the tab bar at the top left of your screen you will find **Node1 Web** and **Node2 Web** tabs.
2. Click on **Node1 Web**, check the message
