üìä Recap and review
===
#### Estimated time to complete: *5 minutes*<p>

Now that we have created our Inventory, Projects and Job Templates, as well as run a full Workflow, let's get back to the **Views** section and look a bit at the new graphs and data shown in each of them.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Review the Dashboard view
===

1. Visit the **Dashboard** view and notice the difference when we first started. You should be seeing 4 hosts, 2 inventories and 3 projects. Also, you will notice a green line in the graph, showing the successful executions of our Job Templates.
2. You can dive deeper by clicking on the **Recent Jobs** and **Recent Templates** tabs right above the line graph.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Review the Jobs view
===

1. Another way to look at the executed jobs is to go to the **Jobs** link in the sidebar, under the **Views** section.
2. Notice they are not only **Playbook runs**, but also **Source control updates**. The **Jobs** view will show everything we **Launched** (rocket icon).

‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Review the Activities Stream view
===

1. In the **Activities Stream** view you will see the individual **Events** that are executed as part of our different tasks. You will notice this are more granular and include the user who run them.
