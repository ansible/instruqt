üîê 1.3 - Credentials
===

[Credentials](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html) are utilized by automation controller for authentication when launching jobs against machines, synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.

Credentials are imported and stored encrypted within automation controller, and are not retrievable in plain text on the command line by any user.  You can grant users and teams the ability to use these credentials, without actually exposing the credential to the user itself.

There are multiple types of credential types, ranging from tokens, to user/passwords or public keys. In total, there are over 20 supported types and even the option to create *Custom* ones. We will explore the **Machine** credential type today, which we will use to connect to the servers in our inventory through SSH.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In this excercise we are not making any changes. Credentials are pre-loaded.


‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Exploring the Credentials section
===

1. Click the **Credentials** link in the **Resources** section of the sidebar
2. This will display a searchable list of pre-loaded credentials, classified by name and type.
3. Look for the `lab-credentials`, notice it says **Machine** type. Click on it.
4. Here you can see the details of the credential. Notice the **SSH Private Key** field.
5. Click the **Access** tab to see who has access to use this credential. These are the automation controller users.
6. Click the **Job Templates** tab to see what Jobs are currently using this credential. It should be empty right now.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Exploring the Machine Type credential
===

1. Go back to the **Details** tab of the **lab-credentials**
2. Click the **Edit** button
3. Look at the different fields available.
4. Notice how the **SSH Private Key** field only allows us to **Reset**. As we mentioned before, the key is encrypted and not retrievable.
5. To exit, click the **Cancel** button to avoid accidental modifications.
