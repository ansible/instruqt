üí° 1.5 - Projects
===

We already have a **Project** called `Apache playbooks` from a previous challenge, where we can find the `apache.yml` and `test_apache_role.yml`  playbooks.

In this new challenge, we are going to create a second project named `Additional playbooks`, which will include the following playbooks: `extended_services.yml` (installs postfix and postgresql), `motd_facts.yml` (sets a message of the day) and `loop_users.yml` (creates multiple users).



‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Creating the second Project
===

1. Click the **Projects** link in the **Resources** section of the sidebar
2. Click the **Add** button
3. **Name** the Project as `Additional playbooks`
4. For the **Source Control Type** dropdown, select **Git**, this will enable new fields below.
5. For the **Source Control URL** field, copy & paste the following URL
  ```
  https://github.com/leogallego/instruqt-wyfp-additional.git
  ```
6. Leave all the other fields the same and click **Save**

‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Verify the new Project synced successfully
===

1. After saving, you should be taken to the **Details** of the project we just created
2. The **Last Job Status** should display **Running** in blue, give it a few seconds
3. If it changed to **Successful** and is showing in green, the project synced correctly.

As an alternative, to see the status of multiple projects, you can:
1. Click the **Projects** link in the **Resources** section of the sidebar
2. Check the **Status** column for the project is green and reads **Successful**
3. Click the **Successful** and review the output of the sync
