  # Introduction to Ansible automation controller

  Welcome to our interactive lab on Ansible automation controller, the web-based UI interface for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

  In this lab, we will demonstrate how easy it is to use Automation Controller (formerly Ansible Tower) by running some of the playbooks from the "Writing your first playbook" laboratory.

  This intro laboratory is useful for both, beginners and experienced Ansible CLI users. No prior knowledge is required. We will create an **Inventory** to manage our servers, import our playbooks into **Projects**, create **Job Templates** to run the them and finally, create a condition based **Workflow** .

  This lab covers the following topics for automation controller:

  * Exploring the dashboard and web-UI interface
  * Creating and managing our `Inventory`
  * How to import playbooks through `Projects`
  * How to create `Job Templates` to run our playbooks
  * Understanding the `Credentials` feature to configure authentication
  * How to create  `Workflow Templates` linking different playbooks through conditions

  We will also explore a few of the additional features in the automation controller that can help with your enterprise automation needs, and we will dive deeper into them in a future laboratory.
