üîó 1.7 - Workflows
===

A [Workflow Job Template](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/workflow_templates.html) links together a sequence of disparate resources that accomplishes the task of tracking the full set of jobs that were part of the release process as a single unit. These resources may include:

- job templates
- workflow templates
- project syncs
- inventory source syncs

Only **Workflow Templates** have the Workflow Visualizer icon (wf-viz-icon) as a shortcut for accessing the workflow editor.

**Note**: Remember, do not confuse a **Job Template** with a **Jinja template**, or now with **Workflow Job Template**.  They are 3 separate things.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Creating a Workflow Template
===

1. Click the **Templates** link in the **Resources** section of the sidebar
2. Click the **Add** dropdown button and select **Add workflow template**
3. **Name** the Workflow Template as `Your first workflow`. Leave everything else the same and click **Save**.
4. This will take you to the Workflow Visualizer screen, where you have to click **Start**
5. You will be presented with the **Add Node** pop-up screen.
6. For the **Node Type**, select **Job Template** (default)
7. Select the `Install Apache`  Job Template
8. Click the **Save** button.
9. You will be presented with a graphical representation, showing a **Start** box followed by the `Install Apache` box, now when you hover your mouse pointer over this job template, you will see the following options: Add a new node, view node details, edit node, link to available node and delete node.
10. Click the **Add a new node**
11. You will be presented with 3 options: On success, on failure and always. Select **On Success** and click **Next**
12. Select the `Extended services` Job Template. Click **Save**
13. You have created a **Workflow Job Template** consisting of 2 **Job Templates**. You can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel.
14. Let's add a third node. Click the **Add a new node** again, from the same `Install Apache` box as before. We are going to run 2 playbooks in parallel after that one, the `Extended services` you just created and a new one.
15. Select **On Success** again as the condition.
16. Select the `Set motd` Job Template. Click **Save**
17. Your workflow should have 3 Job Templates now.
18. Click the top right **Save** button to save changes and exit the Visualizer screen.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Launch the new Workflow
===

1. Click the **Templates** link in the **Resources** section of the sidebar
2. You can launch the Workflow from this list by clicking the **Rocket** icon, or
3. You can click on the `Your first workflow`  name and click the **Launch** button.
4. You will be presented with a smaller Workflow Visualizer that shows the progress of the execution as **Running**
5. Verify the execution was successful by checking all the **Job Templates** have a green border and a green tick.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Success or failure? Challenge time!
===

1. If it failed, why did it fail? Click the red **Failed** and read the output message.
2. It reports the playbook couldn't find the destination hosts or group in the inventory
3. Try to fix it. You need a `database` group in the inventory and to add a `node3` to it.
4. Re run the Workflow.
5. If you are having trouble solving it, you can Skip and it will be solved for you.
