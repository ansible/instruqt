 üí° 1.2 - Projects
===

A **[Project](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/projects.html)** in automation controller is one or more Ansible playbooks inside a directory or Source Control Management system.

We use **Projects** to "*import*" our playbooks into automation controller. These playbooks might be in a source control management (SCM) like Git (in Github or Gitlab for ex.) or locally. Automation controller doesn't allow us to create or edit playbooks through the web-UI, we can only "*import*" them into **Projects** which we later run through the Job Templates feature, which we will review further ahead.

In this challenge, you will create your first **Project** which will import a Github repository with a few Apache playbooks developed in the "Writing your first playbook" laboratory. This playbook installs apache, starts the service and copies an index.html file.


‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Creation of the Project
===

1. Click the **Projects** link in the **Resources** section of the sidebar
2. Click the **Add** button
3. **Name** the Project as `Apache playbooks`
4. For the **Source Control Type** dropdown, select **Git**, this will enable new fields below.
5. For the **Source Control URL** field copy & paste the following URL:
   ```
	 https://github.com/leogallego/instruqt-wyfp.git
	 ```
6. Leave all the other fields the same and click **Save**

‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Verify the new Project synced successfully
===

1. Click the **Projects** link in the **Resources** section of the sidebar
2. Verify that the **Status** for our `Apache playbooks` project is green and reads **Successful**
3. Click the **Successful** and review the output of the sync
