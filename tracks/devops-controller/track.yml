  ***

  [Automation controller](https://www.ansible.com/products/controller) offers an extensive API, webhooks and workflows to integrate with existing technologies and elevate your DevOps practices across the enterprise.

  ACME Corp, our example company in this lab, needs to deploy their *Let’s Quiz!* application. Currently, their Jenkins pipeline only does basic development tasks, such as static code checking, and deploying it into production is still a manual handover to operations.

  This lab covers:

  * Configuring Jenkins using automation controller.
  * Integrating Jenkins into automation controller.
  * Creating a new application release, configuring a web server and deploying the updated *Let’s Quiz!* application with a [controller workflow](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/workflows.html).
  * Using a controller [approval](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/4.2.0/html/userguide/workflow_templates.html#approval-nodes) to allow final checks and sign-off before deploying to production.
