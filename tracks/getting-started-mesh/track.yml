  The [automation mesh](https://www.ansible.com/blog/whats-new-in-ansible-automation-platform-2.1-automation-mesh) component of Ansible Automation Platform is a multi-directional, multi-hopped overlay network of nodes delivering automation across constrained networks, such as DMZs and VPCs, to local and remote endpoints across the globe.

  In this lab, we’ll join ACME Corp, our fictitious company, as they configure mesh, use it to run automation in remote locations, and overcome a network outage using native mesh features.

  This lab covers:

  * Automation mesh node types and features.
  * How to use automation controller logically group automation mesh nodes.
  * Using automation mesh in multi-site environments.
  * Automation mesh resiliency and building redundancy into Ansible Automation platform design.
