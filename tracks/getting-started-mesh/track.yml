  The [automation mesh](https://www.ansible.com/blog/whats-new-in-ansible-automation-platform-2.1-automation-mesh) component of Ansible Automation Platform is a multi-directional, multi-hopped overlay network of nodes delivering automation across constrained networks, such as DMZs and VPCs, to local and remote endpoints across the globe.

  In this lab, weâ€™ll join ACME Corp, our fictitious company, as they configure mesh, use it to run automation in remote locations, and overcome a network outage using native mesh features.

  This lab covers:

  * Automation mesh node types and features.
  * How to use automation controller logically group automation mesh nodes.
  * Using automation mesh in multi-site environments.
  * Automation mesh resiliency and building redundancy into Ansible Automation platform design.
