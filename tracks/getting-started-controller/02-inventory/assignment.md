## Create the following in the controller dashboard:

*Login credentials:*<p>
User: admin <p>
Password: ansible123!

> **Note:**<p>
>
> All the fields are **case-sensitive** and the check will fail! Please maske sure you use the same capitalization as used in the assignments.

Besides the automation controller instance, your sandbox environment also contains two virtual machines: `host01` and `host02`.

We've also added extra terminal tabs to these machines, so you can have a look around.

These machines are configured to be able to `ssh` to each other using an ssh key.

## Your assignment

All tasks are performed in the automation controller dashboard
* On the side navigation under the **Resources** section, click on **Inventories**
* Under **Inventories**, click on **Add**
* Create a new Inventory called `Lab-Inventory`
