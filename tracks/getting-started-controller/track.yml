  # Automation controller
  * * *
  <br>

  [**Automation controller**](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/administration/index.html), formerly known as [Ansible Tower](https://www.ansible.com/products/tower), allows users of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform to define, operate, scale, and delegate automation across their enterprise.


  Manage inventory, launch and schedule workflows, track changes, and integrate into external systems, all from a centralized user interface and REST API.

  In this track you:

  * Will get to know the **automation controller** interface
  * Create a standard inventory and add hosts
  * Run automation using a job template on our inventory
