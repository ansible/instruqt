  [`ansible-navigator`](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-navigator) is the new command-line tool that provides a more cohesive and consistent experience for automation creators.


  [`ansible-navigator`](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-navigator) is included in Ansible Automation Platform 2 and leverages your existing CLI knowledge (`ansible-playbook`) while also introducing enhancements for containerized execution.


  In this series of challenges, we'll install [`ansible-navigator`](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-navigator) and run through simple use-cases to highlight it's functionality and enhancements.
