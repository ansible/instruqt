    In this challenge, we'll install *ansible-navigator* and cover a few basics when using the tool.

    **1.** Create a project directory and `cd` into it:
    ```
    mkdir project_directory && cd project_directory
    ```

    ***

    **2.** Create a new python virtual environment and activate it:
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    ***

    **3.** Install `ansible-navigator`:
    ```
    pip install ansible-navigator
    ```

    ***

    **4.** Quickly test that navigator has been installed, run:
    ```
    ansible-navigator --help
    ```

    ***

    Now that we know `ansible-navigator` was installed succesfully, try running the provided playbook using `ansible-navigator`:
    ```
    ansible-navigator --execution-environment false run ../test-playbook/test.yml -i ../test-playbook/hosts
    ```

    Looking the output of the above command, press number '0' in order to inspect the first play, and press '0' again to inspect the task. Pressing 'esc' twice will exit `ansible-navigator`.
