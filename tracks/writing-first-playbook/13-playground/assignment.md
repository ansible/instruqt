👋 Introduction
===
Feel free to take the rest of the time and explore what you can do with an Ansible playbook.

Did you know you could access Ansible documents directly from the man pages?

For example, imagine you wanted to learn more about downloading files from the web?

Check out:

```
ansible-doc ansible.builtin.get_url
```

Hope you enjoyed the lab!
