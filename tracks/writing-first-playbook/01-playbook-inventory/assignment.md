title: The Basics & Creating an inventory
teaser: Write your inventory, know whom Ansible talks to!
notes:
- type: text
  contents: Ansible works against multiple managed nodes or ‚Äúhosts‚Äù in your infrastructure
    at the same time, using a list or group of lists known as inventory. For our first
    challenge, we are going to create an inventory to be used in the following challenges.
- type: text
  contents: The inventory tells what nodes are out there to be used by Ansible, what
    credentials need to be used to connect to them, how the nodes are grouped, and
    other necessary variables.
- type: text
  contents: |-
    An example inventory:

    ```
    [all:vars]
    ansible_user=rhel
    ansible_password=SomethingSomething
    ansible_port=22

    [web]
    websrv1
    websrv2

    [db]
    db_1 ansible_host=11.22.33.44
    db_2 ansible_host=44.55.66.77
    ```

üëã Introduction
===
#### Estimated time to complete: *3 minutes*<p>
Welcome to the writing your first Ansible playbook. In the following challenges and tasks we will guide you in the creation process to get you started writing Ansible playbooks. In this challenge, you will learn about ansible-navigator and create an inventory file for a set of hosts and group them into the group labeled *web*.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - What is Ansible Navigator?
===

Ansible navigator is a command based tool for creating, reviewing and troubleshooting Ansible content. This includes inventories, playbooks, and collections.

In the following challenges ahead you will use `ansible-navigator` to run Ansible playbooks.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Creation of Inventory file
===
* The *editor* tab is open by default.

An inventory file is a text file that specifices the nodes that will be managed by the control machine. The nodes to be managed may include a list of hostnames or IP addresses of those nodes. The inventory file allows for nodes to be organized into groups by declaring a host group name within square brackets ([]).

You'll see one folder labeled `ansible-files` in the left pane. This folder will contain our inventory file and future playbooks.

Currently, the one file residing in the `ansible-files` directory is the `ansible-navigator.yml`. The `ansible-navigator.yml` file contains all the settings to properly run this lab. Feel free to investigate but please don't make any changes.

Within the editor tab, open the directory `ansible-files`. In that directory, right click and create the file `hosts`.

![Create File](../assets/create_file.png)

Within the file hosts, supply the following content:

```
[web]
node1
node2
```

‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - How to use Ansible Navigator?
===

Ansible navigator comes with an interactive mode by default that allows you to explore the different options. Within this lab, we set the mode of `ansible-navigator` to `stdout`.

Within the *control* tab, change to the `ansible-files` directory and run the following commands to get a listing of what is available within our inventory, run:

```
cd ansible-files
```

```
ansible-navigator inventory --list
```

If the `--list` is too verbose, the option of `--graph` can be used to provide a more condensed version of `--list`.

```
ansible-navigator inventory --graph
```

In following challenges you will familarize yourself with the `ansible-navigator run` command that allows us to run Ansible playbooks.
