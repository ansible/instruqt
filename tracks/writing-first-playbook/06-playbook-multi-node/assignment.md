teaser: Real automation speaks to multiple hosts.
notes:
- type: text
  contents: |-
    The real power of Ansible is to apply the same set of tasks reliably to many hosts.

    So what about changing the apache.yml Playbook to run on node1 and node2?
- type: text
  contents: To do that, the playbook will not target an individual  node in the future,
    but instead a group of nodes. Ansible automatically identifies all hosts in the
    group via the inventory.
- type: text
  contents: As a best practice Ansible in real life applications playbooks are usually
    written adressing the group `all` - the limitation to certain nodes or groups
    is enforced at execution time via command line flags or via tools like Ansible
    controller.

üëã Introduction
===
#### Estimated time to complete: *3 minutes*<p>
In this challenge, you will modify your Ansible Playbook to target not just one host (`node1`) but to modify a group of hosts (`web`) and run the playbook on all hosts within the `web` group.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Modify hosts
===
* The *editor* tab is open by default.

In the editor, open the `apache.yml` file and modify the `hosts` line value from `node1` to `web`.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Run the apache.yml Ansible Playbook
===

Within the *control* tab, run the Ansible playbook `apache.yml`

```
cd ansible-files
```
```
ansible-navigator run apache.yml
```

>### **‚ùóÔ∏è WARNING**
>The playbook task may take a minute or two to complete as it is populating the repository metadata for the first time on `node2`.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Verify Apache is running on web hosts
===
Once the Ansible Playbook successfully completes, run the following Ansible ad-hoc command to verify the Apache (`httpd`) service is running on all hosts within the `web` group.

```
ansible web -m ansible.builtin.service_facts | grep httpd.service -A4
```

```
            "httpd.service": {
                "name": "httpd.service",
                "source": "systemd",
                "state": "running",
                "status": "enabled"
            },
--
            "httpd.service": {
                "name": "httpd.service",
                "source": "systemd",
                "state": "running",
                "status": "enabled"
            },
```
