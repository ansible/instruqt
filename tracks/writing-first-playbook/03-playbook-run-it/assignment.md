    In the last challenge we created the playbook. Now it is time to launch it!

    We do this with the command `ansible-navigator` - one of the central commands of Ansible on the command line!

  contents: During the task you might be wondering how `ansible-navigator` actually
    knows where to find the `hosts` file - this is configured in the file `/home/rhel/ansible-files/ansible-navigator.yml`
    which was pre-created in this environment. If you have time have a look at it,
    it should be fairly self-explanatory.

üëã Introduction
===
#### Estimated time to complete: *5 minutes*<p>
In this challenge, you will execute an Ansible Playbook from the control node using the `ansible-navigator` tool.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Run the apache.yml Ansible Playbook
===
* The *control* tab is open by default.

Within the *control* tab, change into the `ansible-files` directory:

```
cd ansible-files
```

Run the playbook:

```
ansible-navigator run apache.yml
```
>### **‚ùóÔ∏è WARNING**
>The playbook task may take a minute or two to complete as it is populating the repository metadata for the first time.

>### **‚ùóÔ∏è Note**
>`-i hosts` option is not required as the `ansible-navigator.yml` file has already set the default location of the inventory.

The output should not report any errors but provide an overview of the tasks executed and a play recap summarizing what has been done.

```
ansible-navigator run apache.yml
```
```
PLAY [Apache server installed] *************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [node1]

TASK [latest Apache version installed] *****************************************
changed: [node1]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
node1                      : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
```
There is a built-in task labeled `Gathering Facts` that runs automatically at the beginning of each Ansible play. It collects information about the managed nodes.

Upcoming challenges will cover this in more detail.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Verify Apache installed
===

The `apache.yml` playbook installs Apache (`httpd` package) on the host `node1`. A simple method to verify the results that the package did indeed install, is to use an Ansible ad-hoc command to verify the results.

```
ansible node1 -m ansible.builtin.shell -a "rpm -qi httpd"
```

```
node1 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
Name        : httpd

Summary     : Apache HTTP Server
Description :
The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, efficient, and extensible
web server.
```

This uses the module (-m) `ansible.builtin.shell` with module arguments (-a) that states to run the following command `rpm -qi httpd` on `node1`.

The output lists the name, version and other details about the package.



‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Idempotency at work
===

Run the Ansible Playbook a second time and compare the output to the original. You will notice the tasks change from `changed` to `ok` including the colors changing from `yellow` to `green`. Additionally, the *PLAY RECAP* is different as well making it easier to spot the changes made by Ansible.

```
ansible-navigator run apache.yml
```

```
PLAY [Apache server installed] *************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [node1]

TASK [latest Apache version installed] *****************************************
ok: [node1]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
node1                      : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
```

Why does this happen?

Due to idempotency. The Ansible Playbook can be run numerous times but only does it make a change the first time due to this being the only time that `node1` does not have the `httpd` package installed. Once the package is installed, Ansible recognizes this and gives a status of *ok* letting us know that indeed the package is present.
