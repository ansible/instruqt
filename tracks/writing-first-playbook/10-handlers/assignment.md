üëã Introduction
===
#### Estimated time to complete: *5 minutes*<p>
In this challenge, you will use a handler to notify a restart of Apache when changes to an `httpd.conf` file have taken place.


‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Create a new playbook
===
* The *editor* tab is open by default.

Open the *editor* tab, and create the file `httpd_conf.yml`. This can be done by simply right clicking and selecting 'New File'.

Within the `httpd_conf.yml`, add the following content. The following playbook manages Apache's configuration file `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` on all hosts within the `web` group. It then restarts Apache when the file has changed.

```
---
- name: manage httpd.conf
  hosts: web
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: Copy Apache configuration file
    copy:
      src: httpd.conf
      dest: /etc/httpd/conf/
    notify:
      - restart_apache
  handlers:
    - name: restart_apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
```

Understanding the playbook:

* The `notify` section calls the handler only when the copy task actually changes the file. That way the service is only restarted if needed - and not each time the playbook is run.

* The `handlers` section defines a task that is only run on notification.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Copy the httpd.conf file to control node
===

Within the *control* tab, copy the `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` file from `node1` to the `/home/rhel/ansible-files/files/` location.

```
scp node1:/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf /home/rhel/ansible-files/files/.
```

‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Run the httpd_conf.yml playbook
===

Within the *control* tab, change directory to `ansible-files` and run the `httpd_conf.yml` playbook.

```
cd ansible-files
```

```
ansible-navigator run httpd_conf.yml
```
```
```

Notice anything with the output?

Nothing was changed, thus the playbook ran and you will notice the PLAY RECAP does not show any `changed` lines.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 4 - Modify the httpd.conf file
===

Within the *editor* tab, modify the `ansible-files/files/httpd.conf` and change the `Listen 80` line in `ansible-files/files/httpd.conf` to:

```
Listen 8081
```

‚òëÔ∏è Task 5 - Run the httpd_conf.yml playbook
===

Within the *control* tab, run the playbook again.

```
ansible-navigator run httpd_conf.yml
```
```
```

Now the Ansible playbook output should be a lot more interesting:

* `httpd.conf` should have been copied over
* The handler should have restarted Apache

‚òëÔ∏è Task 6 - Verify Apache listening on port 8081
===

Within the *control* tab, run the following `curl` command

```
curl http://node1
```

```
curl: (7) Failed to connect to node1 port 80: Connection refused
```

```
curl http://node1:8081
```
```

<h1>This is a development webserver, have fun!</h1>
