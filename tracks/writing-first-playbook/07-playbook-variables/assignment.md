title: Adding variables to the mix
teaser: Ansible supports variables to store values that can be used in Playbooks.  Let's
  do this.
notes:
- type: text
  contents: Ansible supports variables to store values that can be used in Playbooks.
    Variables can be defined in a variety of places and have a clear precedence. Ansible
    substitutes the variable with its value when a task is executed.
- type: text
  contents: |-
    Variables are referenced in Ansible Playbooks by placing the variable name in double curly braces:

    ```
    Here comes a variable {{ variable1 }}
    ```

  contents: 'Variables and their values can be defined in various places: the inventory,
    additional files, on the command line, etc.'
- type: text
  contents: |-
    The recommended practice to provide variables in the inventory is to define them in files located in two directories named `host_vars` and `group_vars`:

    * To define variables for a group ‚Äúservers‚Äù, a YAML file named `group_vars/servers.yml` with the variable definitions is created.
    * To define variables specifically for a host node1, the file `host_vars/node1.yml` with the variable definitions is created.

üëã Introduction
===
#### Estimated time to complete: *10 minutes*<p>
In this challenge, you will familarize yourself with the use of variables specified in different locations `group_vars` and `host_vars`. Each location provides different behavior.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Creation of variable directories
===

In this task you will create two directories within `ansible-files`, `group_vars` and `host_vars`. Right click and select 'New Folder' to create each of them.

The objective is to save different variables for specified hosts and for an entire group.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Creation the group_vars/web.yml file
===

Create the file  `~/ansible-files/group_vars/web.yml` with the following content:

```
---
stage: dev
```

The `group_vars/web.yml` file provides the value `dev` to a variable labeled `stage`.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Creation the host_vars/node1.yml file
===

Create the file `~/ansible-files/host_vars/node1.yml` with the following content:

```
---
stage: prod
```

The `host_vars/node1.yml` file provides the value `prod` to a variable labeled `stage`.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 4 - Creation of the web.html stage files
===

Depending on the stage variable that is selected, the Ansible playbook shall copy a different web.html file.

Let's create two stage files. First the file `~/ansible-files/files/prod_web.html` with the content:

```
<body>
<h1>This is a production webserver, take care!</h1>
</body>
```

Second create the file `~/ansible-files/files/dev_web.html` with the content:

```
<body>
<h1>This is a development webserver, have fun!</h1>
</body>
```

‚òëÔ∏è Task 5 - Modify the apache.yml playbook using the stage variable
===

Modify the copy task of the existing `apache.yml` playbook as follows:

```
  - name: copy web.html
    ansible.builtin.copy:
      src: "{{ stage }}_web.html"
      dest: /var/www/html/index.html
```

‚òëÔ∏è Task 6 - Run the apache.yml playbook
===

Within the *control* tab, run the playbook:

```
cd ansible-files
```

```
ansible-navigator run apache.yml
```

‚òëÔ∏è Task 7 - Verify Results
===

The `node1` server should point to the production web page. The `node2` server should point to the development web page.

```
curl http://node1
```
```
<body>
    <h1>This is a production webserver, take care!</h1>
    </body>
```

```
curl http://node2
```

```
<body>
    <h1>This is a development webserver, have fun!</h1>
    </body>
```
