    The real power of Ansible is to apply the same set of tasks reliably to many hosts.
    What about running our Playbook on multiple nodes?
    To do that, the playbook will not target an individual node in the future, but instead a group of nodes. Ansible automatically identifies all hosts in the group via the inventory.

üëã 1.3 - From 1 to many
===

The biggest strength of automation lies in its ability to manage multiple systems simultaneously. In this challenge, you will modify your Ansible Playbook to target not just one host (`node1`), but to modify a group of hosts (`web`) and run the playbook on all hosts within that group.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Modify hosts in the playbook
===

> [!NOTE]
> In the *VSCode Editor* tab

Open your `system_setup.yml` playbook and modify the `hosts:` line value from the individual `node1` to the `web` group. Look at the example below:

```
---
- name: Basic System Setup
  hosts: web
  become: true
```

‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Run the system_setup.yml  playbook again
===

> [!NOTE]
> Switch to the *Control* top tab.

Go into the playbook directory:

```
cd ansible-files
```

And run the Ansible playbook again with `ansible-navigator`

```
ansible-navigator run system_setup.yml
```

> [!WARNING]
> The playbook task may take a minute or two to complete as it is populating the repository metadata and updating packages for the `node2`.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Verify myuser exists in both nodes
===
Once the Ansible Playbook successfully completes, run the following steps to check manually `myuser` exists in both servers.

For node1:
```
ssh node1 id myuser
```

For node2:
```
ssh node2 id myuser
```

Output should be similar to the following:

```
uid=1008(myuser) gid=1009(myuser) groups=1009(myuser)
```
