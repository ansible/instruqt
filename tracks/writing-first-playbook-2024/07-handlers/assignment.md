    Sometimes when a task does make a change to the system, an additional task or tasks may need to be run. For example, a change to a service‚Äôs configuration file may then require that the service be restarted so that the changed configuration takes effect.

üëã 1. 6 - Handlers
===

Handlers are used for tasks that should only run when notified by another task. Typically, they are used to restart services after a configuration change.

Let's say we want to ensure the firewall is configured correctly on all web servers and then reload the firewall service to apply any new settings. We'll define a handler that reloads the firewall service and is notified by a task that ensures the desired firewall rules are in place:

‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Extend the system_setup.yml playbook to add the firewall tasks
===

> [!NOTE]
>  In the *VSCode Editor* tab

Open the *Editor* tab, and edit the `system_setup.yml` playbook. Make sure you add the new tasks below related to the firewall. Remember to check the indentation!

```
---
- name: Basic System Setup
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    user_name: 'padawan'
    package_name: httpd
    apache_service_name: httpd
  tasks:
    - name: Install security updates for the kernel
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: 'kernel'
        state: latest
        security: true
        update_only: true
      when: inventory_hostname in groups['web']

    - name: Create a new user
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: "{{ user_name }}"
        state: present
        create_home: true

    - name: Install Apache on web servers
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: "{{ package_name }}"
        state: present
      when: inventory_hostname in groups['web']

    - name: Ensure Apache is running and enabled
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: "{{ apache_service_name }}"
        state: started
        enabled: true
      when: inventory_hostname in groups['web']

    - name: Install firewalld
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: firewalld
        state: present
      when: inventory_hostname in groups['web']

    - name: Ensure firewalld is running
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: firewalld
        state: started
        enabled: true
      when: inventory_hostname in groups['web']

    - name: Allow HTTP traffic on web servers
      ansible.posix.firewalld:
        service: http
        permanent: true
        state: enabled
      when: inventory_hostname in groups['web']
      notify: Reload Firewall

  handlers:
    - name: Reload Firewall
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: firewalld
        state: reloaded
```

Understanding the playbook:
* The `notify` section calls the handler only if the "**Allow HTTP traffic on web servers**" task makes any changes in one of the hosts. That way the service is only reloaded if needed - and not each time the playbook is run.
* The `handlers` section defines a task that is only run on notification. And the `name` field is used to call it from a task.

> [!WARNING]
> Notice how the `name` of the `handlers`  is used within the `notify` section of the **‚ÄúAllow HTTP traffic on web servers‚Äù** configuration task. This ensures that the proper handler is executed as there can be multiple handlers within an Ansible playbook.


‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Run the system_setup.yml playbook
===

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Control** tab

Change directory to `ansible-files` and run the playbook:

```
cd ansible-files
```

```
ansible-navigator run system_setup.yml
```




‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Run the system_setup.yml playbook again to test the handler
===

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Control** tab

Run the playbook again.

```
ansible-navigator run system_setup.yml
```

Notice anything with the output?

Nothing was changed, thus the playbook ran and you will notice the PLAY RECAP does not show any `changed` lines. The firewall was not restarted as there was no changes.



‚òëÔ∏è Task 6 - Verify Apache listening on port 80
===

> [!NOTE]
> Check the new **Node1 Web** tab at the top, next to the **Control** tab.

1. You should see the following webpage after the playbook has run (give it a few seconds or click the small arrow inside the tab next to the **Node1 Web** title if you are seeing another message):

![image.png](../assets/image.png)


> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively, you can check in the CLI using the **Control** tab.

For the CLI check, as the output would be too long, we are using grep to get just a few lines:

```
curl http://node1 | grep "HTTP Server"
```

Now let's try with `node3`, the server in the `[database]` group:

```
curl http://node3
```

The output should look like this:
```
curl: (7) Failed to connect to node3 port 80: Connection refused
```
