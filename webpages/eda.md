# Gitops with event-driven ansible 

Event-driven ansible is a brand new technology that helps to associate upstream events with downstream actions. In this lab, you will first learn how to conditionally act on specific events by creating a rulebook which can be evaluated against an event source. Next, you will learn how to act on events in a familiar GitOps scenario.
