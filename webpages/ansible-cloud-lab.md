# Introduction to cloud automation

This self-paced lab will demonstrate how Ansible Automation Platform can help you orchestrate, operationalize and govern your hybrid cloud environments. Use-cases will include infrastructure visibility, compliance and infrastructure optimization. Learn how Ansible can start helping you tame your hybrid cloud deployments today. This self-paced lab requires students to have beginner level knowledge of common public cloud terminology and limited to no knowledge of Ansible.

> **NOTE** 
> 
> You will have the option to use **Microsoft Azure** or **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** for each exercise.

## Lab Agenda

- **Infrastructure visibility** [Estimated Time ⏰ 20 minutes] - 
  
  In this lab we will illustrate how we can retrieve Ansible facts (key, value pairs), also known as structured data, from public clouds and how we can use this data to provide us awareness of our cloud footprint easily
    - [Start exercise on AWS](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/redhat/tracks/cloud-visibility?token=em_IYvE6P3BoPg-Fo50)
    - [Start exercise on  Azure](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/redhat/tracks/ansible-for-azure-infrastructure-visibility?token=em_b_TKcpWZfvC6Jbwe)
- **Cloud Operations** [Estimated Time ⏰ 20 minutes] - 
  
  This lab will illustrate how Ansible Automation Platform can help you automate common day-2 cloud operations tasks across your public cloud. Our focus here will be on AWS, but the use cases here are ones you can extend across the hybrid cloud.

- **Infrastructure optimization** [Estimated Time ⏰ 20 minutes] - 
  
  In this lab we will guide you in understanding some basic optimization exercises that can help you tame your public clouds.

Optional Lab
- [Terraforming Clouds with Ansible](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/redhat/tracks/terraform-ansible?token=em_9xhy_e8tyoPKFdab) [Estimated Time ⏰ 60 minutes] - In this lab we explore the basics of Terraform and how we can use it to deploy infrastructure. We then take it up a level by introducing Ansible's Automation controller and simplify the creation of this infrastructure as well as bring the all important post-provisioning tasks which we all need to do when infrastructure is being configured. This lab will get you creating infrastructure with Terraform and Automation controller in no time
