# Ansible Lightspeed and Development Technical Workshop

This workshop is for the Ansible automation engineer or application developer.  While their experience, skills, and job roles differ, both of these personas create automation.  This includes writing Ansible Playbooks, Ansible Roles, and Ansible Content Collections and learning how to distribute these throughout the organization..  This workshop will provide an opinionated experience for both of these roles.

The Ansible developer experience includes numerous capabilities to aid in the creation of Ansible automation content.  This includes an Ansible plugin for Microsoft Visual Studio Code as well as generative AI (artificial intelligence) integrations such as Red Hat Lightspeed.

After finishing this lab you are ready to start taking advantage of the numerous Ansible content tools included in your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscription.

> **IMPORTANT TO NOTE** 
> 
> This workshop is focused on the automation development capabilities of Ansible and is highly focused on using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), Visual Studio Code, as well as other various CLI tools that run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  It is highly encouraged to attend the Ansible Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workshop before attending this workshop.
