# Images for Instruqt

Instruqt will use GCP images tied to your GCP account.  For the MBU our account is named "Red Hat MBU" (slug is `red-hat-mbu`).

To figure out the name of images check out this link:

## Containers

Upstream container images can also be used. Please refer to the [Containers for Instruqt page](../containers/README.md)for examples.

## Setup-scripts

Everything contained in `ansible/setup-scripts` will be copied to the tmp dir on Tower when the image is built. These scripts are used to configure Tower for that particular exercise (e.g. remove all non windows modules from the adhoc drop down for windows tracks). Unfortunately, just dropping the playbooks into the challenge directory for that track and then running `ansible-playbook` from the bash script doesn't do it. This is temporary until figuring out something more elegant.

The idea here is that we can cut down on image configuration by configuring the instance for each track using ansible. The downside, if there's a lot of instance configuration needed, the startup time will suffer.

## Building images

The cloud of choice for Instruqt is GCP. Images are currently built on GCP using Packer. Install packer and gcloud on your workstation. You should now be able to login to gcloud using something like `gcloud auth application-default login`. [More info on GCP auth](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default).

Take a look at the packer files `*.pkr.hcl` for current images to get an idea of what is going on. Once your build file has been customized for your use case run `packer build your-image.pkr.hcl`. If your image already exists within the GCP project specified in the packer file, you can force the refresh of the image like so: `packer build --force your-image.pkr.hcl`

When creating a new track, you should be able to specify the path the new image using `project-name/image-name`

## Extra vars file

The `ansible_vars_file` packer variable enables you to specify a file with additional Ansible variables. This variable is available in the  `automation-controller.pkr.hcl`, `ansible.pkr.hcl` and `mesh-node.pkr.hcl` packer build files. For example:

```packer build --force automation-controller.pkr.hcl -var ansible_vars_file="@<extra_vars.yml location>"```

>**Note**<p>
> Your `extra_vars.yml` file contains sensitive information.<p>
> Ensure it's safe and excluded from repository pull requests and commits.<p>

### Example `extra_vars.yml` file

```yaml
# Extra vars example file for Instruqt automation mesh images

# Red Hat customer portal credentials
redhat_username: 'Your Red hat username'
redhat_password: 'Your Red Hat password'

# registry.redhat.io credentials
registry_username: 'Your registry username'
registry_password: 'Your registry password'

# access.redhat.com offline token. You can retrieve your token from https://access.redhat.com/management/api
offline_token: 'dswrfw8743rliuhfwiu444hweffw.....'
```

## Building automation controller

You are going to need two files in `instruqt/images/ansible`:

1. `offline_token.txt`

which is an offline token to download AAP from access.redhat.com.  This uses the `aap_download` role from the `ansible.workshops` collection.  You can retrieve the offline token from here: [https://access.redhat.com/management/api
](https://access.redhat.com/management/api)

2. `manifest.zip`

This is a license file to apply to AAP.  Please refer to this video by Colin McNaughton [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtilnsk7sM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtilnsk7sM) to figure out how to get your manifest.zip

Place the `manifest.zip` in the `images\ansible` folder.

To execute packer run the following command->

```packer build --force automation-controller.pkr.hcl```

## Building automation mesh images

Automation mesh worker nodes are installed and configured during the automation controller installation. Due to this, building Instruqt images requires additional steps.

### Mesh file and directory structure

```text
.
├── images/
│   ├── ansible/
│   │   ├── templates/
│   │   │   └── "{{ track_slug }}"_inv.yml
│   │   └── vars/
│   │       └── "{{ track_slug }}"_vars.yml     # Vars file included in mesh lab playbooks.
│   └── "{{ track_slug }}"_node_setup.yml       # Playbook used in mesh-node.pkr.hcl Packer file.
└── packer/
    └── mesh-node.pkr.hcl                       # Builds mesh node base image with "{{ track_slug }}"_node_setup.yml.
```

#### The `track_slug` variable

File lookups and naming conventions use `track_slug` variable. Configure `track_slug` using the following methods:

##### Set the `TRACK_SLUG` environment variable

```bash
export TRACK_SLUG='getting-started-edge-lab'
```

##### Add it as an extra variable in `ansible-playbook` command

```bash
ansible-playbook mesh-lab-install -e track_slug='getting-started-edge-lab'
```

##### Add it as an extra variable in `packer` command

```bash
packer build -force -var track_slug='getting-started-edge-lab' images/packer/mesh-node.pkr.hcl
```

#### Mesh extra variables

Mesh node builds require additional variables to work and you can add them in multiple ways.

- `images/ansible/vars/"{{ track_slug }}_vars.yml` variables file. This file is imported in to mesh node Playbooks and Packer files.
- Packer `ansible_vars_file=@<your_vars_file>` variable. Useful to point variable files outside the repo
- Ansible playbook `-e @<your_vars_file>` argument. Useful to point variable files outside the repo.

You can set certain variables using optional environment variables. Useful to keep sensitive information out of the repo.

| **Ansible var**          | **Environment var**      |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| offline_token            | REDHAT_OFFLINE_TOKEN     |
| redhat_username          | REDHAT_USERNAME          |
| redhat_password          | REDHAT_PASSWORD          |
| gcp_service_account      | GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT      |
| gcp_service_account_file | GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE |

Mesh build playbooks check for certain mandatory variables before executing.

| **Variable**             | **Description**                                                                                                                            |

### Mesh node building steps

#### Step 1 - Create the mesh worker node base image using Packer

The mesh worker node base image is used to create mesh worker nodes during the controller install. Run the following command from root repository folder. Optionally, point to external variable files using `-var mesh_extra_vars=@<your_vars_file>` option and set the `track_slug` variable using `-var track_slug=<your_track_slug>`.

```bash
packer build --force -var image_name=<worker_node_base_image> mesh-node.pkr.hcl
```

Here's an example used to create worker node base images for `getting-started-edge-lab`.

```bash
packer build --force -var image_name='edge-lab-node' -var track_slug='getting-started-edge-lab' mesh-node.pkr.hcl
```

#### Step 2 - Run the mesh lab installer using Ansible

The `mesh-lab-install.yml` Ansible playbook runs the AAP installer and configures mesh. The playbook performs the following tasks:

1. Creates GCP instances from their respective base images based on `gcp_instances` variable.
2. Installs automation controller and associated mesh worker nodes using `images/ansible/templates/{{ track_slug }}_inv.j2` inventory - e.g. `getting-started-edge-lab_inv.j2`
3. Creates new images based on `instance_image` variable in `gcp_instances`. Using the example in Step. 1, this would be `edge-lab-node`.
4. list and appends `-image` to the completed image name.
5. Deletes unused instances
6. Makes a cup of coffee if you ask nicely.

Execute the following command in the `images\ansible` folder to build the base mesh worker node images. Optionally, point to external variable files using `-e  @<your_vars_file>` option and set the `track_slug` variable using `-e track_slug=<your_track_slug>`.

```bash
ansible-playbook mesh-generic-lab-install.yml
```

Let's continue with the example in Step 1 used to create worker node base images for `getting-started-edge-lab`.

```bash
ansible-playbook mesh-generic-lab-install.yml -e track_slug='getting-started-edge-lab'
```
